the first thing to do when creating session is to insert into session table;
the session should be added into the session table
the director should be notified to reaward scholarship
when generating receipt for form fees, the payer column is the full name of the payer for the form

for every session, insert values for each school into the fee table with the values from the previous table so it would be available for editing when session is created;

populate the school_fee table for the school for each student corresponding to their level, this must be done after the students have been promoted from or left to repeat their previous class,
notify the APM to update the fees/schedules once new session is started
the token table should be emptied when starting a new session
